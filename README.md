Just Another Way to SQL

Simple database to JSON REST API that accesses a PostgreSQL database.

Geared towards a service to track SQL in a codebase and replace it with API calls.

Thanks to @fastly for the developer survival kit (Knob Creek, bacon chocolate,
phone external battery pack, and Blue Bottle card) which made this possible.
